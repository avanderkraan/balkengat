# Balkengat

This program uses openstreetmap as a base map and openlayer to add/modify/remove your items.  
It can read existing Feature-files if they are in json or geojson format.

## Purpose
Keeps track of the logs that are in 'het balkengat'.

## Usage
Open draw_modify.html in a browser.  
Existing data-file(s) can be dragged onto the browser-window.
If there are more files, they are cumulated and will be saved as a new, single file.  
When saving the name is <YYYY_MM_DD_hh_mm>_export.geojson.
